# covid-19-who-situation-report-cache

This is a cache of situation reports from the World Health Organization on the COVID-19 pandemic. The `manifest.json` files in the different subfolders do not follow a stable schema yet. I have plans to automate collection and possibly even automate extraction of the surveillance data, but that will probably be in another repository.
